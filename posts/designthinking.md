Desing thinking is a **mindset** rather than steps of processes. It encourages to question the actual, underlying causes of the problem and going beyond surface-level observations. Helps to discover breakthrough ideas that may initially seemed far-fetched. Think beyond boundaries and end up with innovative solutions. Iterate on the solutions and adapt on the feedback.

To understand and adapt this mindset, firstly you need to see a problem in a multi-layered structure. Problems comes from humans, humans are complex beings which naturally makes their problems complex. Two most important actions of addressing the core of this multilayered comlexity is questioning and observing.

_Design thinking_ is a **human-centered** problem solving approach. In addition to asking questions to understand, it involves empathizing with users and observing their actions in defining their needs. It is in search of finding the most value by continuously testing multiple solutions with the user until the desired outcome. Design thinking guides you to first iterate on solving the right thing, then iterate on solving the thing right.

**First phase** is understanding the user along with the problem. In this step the most crucial thing is to pay attention to _human actions_, learn about their capabilities, experience their point of view and ask basic questions. Always keep in mind that _'complexity can be best solved by simplicity'_. Like suggesting KISS approach in product, web page, application development... Ask simple questions eventhough they sound stupid. In every iteration of this phase you and your team will discover new user perspectives, user needs which will lead to solution ideas. When you are sure about addressing the correct problem then second phase can start. Additional reading to support this phase is 5 Why...

**Second phase** is to analyze the pain-points and needs of the user as the outcome of the first phase and _converge to the problem_ to solve. Additional reading to support this phase is Negative Brainstroming...

**Third phase** is to create ideas. Again it is time to diverge to ideas. The atmosphere should be open and non-judgemental. Encourage participants for the most radical, seemingle impossible ideas. There are a lot of techniques to practice this, for instance try to create a connection between two random selected unrelated items, or ask to a child and grow on his ideas. Incorporater games, toys or other playful elements during the brainstorming session, try visiting different environments to _stimulate creativity_. Extra reading to support this phase is Think Out of The Box...

**Fourth phase** is to analyze the ideas and converge into solutions. Paper and digital protoyping are the two well known techniques of this phase. To understand how the user experiences the prototypes try _Storyboarding_. Illustrate the _user's journey_ and interactions with the product. Do the _role-playing_ and act as if you are the user, simulating the interactions. Extra reading to support this phase is Wizard of Oz technique...

**Last phase** is to get feedback and insights on the developed prototypes. It is a _validation_ of the proposed solution and _improve_ on the outcomde. Guide the users in the beginning then observe them interacting with the prototype. Additionally _collect feedback_ through surveys, interviews and feedback forms. Extra reading to support this phase is A/B testing...

In conclusion, _design thinking_ is not just a tool or a process; it is a transformative mindset that equips us with the ability to create innovative solutions that address complex human challenges with empathy, creativity, and purpose. Cycling on these phases might seem time-consuming,the investment is well worth it. Keep in mind that _a wrong solution is worse than a no solution_.
